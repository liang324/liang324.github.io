      <title>Underground Disc-cutter Replacement Robot for Tunnel Boring Machine</title>
      <link>https://liang324.github.io/project/2018-tbm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Specialized robot that helps release humans from dangerous TBM maintenance works underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a kind of specialized engineering machine for excavating underground tunnels. The modern TBMs are technology-intensive systems that can perform various comprehensive tasks such as tunnel boring, excavated material removal and tunnel structure supporting at the same time, which greatly improves the overall project efficiency, quality and safety. The cutting head part of a shield TBM is specialized for underground hard rock material tunneling (see the featured figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disc cutters, arranged at the forefront cutting head part of the TBM, are the main cutting tools for cutting hard rock materials. The disc cutters are pressed onto the cutting surface with enough force so that the rock structure will crash as a result. As the cutting head rotates, the disc cutters will rotate round its own shaft and move along circle path on the cutting surface at the same time to form an even full-surface cutting result. The disc cutters will endure large working load to meet the rock crushing result, and they work in a complex extreme situation underground, with high pressure, high humidity and high temperature, so that the disc cutter worn-out and faulty is quite often during the boring process, which may affect the work efficiency and quality or even endanger the TBM system. Therefore, the regular replacement of the worn/damaged disc cutter in time is crucial for the normal running of the TBM machine, maintaining high operation productivity and keeping the system safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims develop unmanned robot that can help release humans from dangerous TBM maintenance works underground.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In-vessel Maintenance Robot for Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://liang324.github.io/project/2015-east/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A robot that works inside Tokamak, an experimental device for nuclear fusion research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokamak is the experiment device for controlled nuclear fusion research, which employs magnetic field to confine the high energy plasma in its toroidal vessel for nuclear fusion activities. The first wall structure of the toroidal vessel is directly exposed to high energy plasma during the experiment and may get damaged after several cycles of plasma discharge experiments. This is a severe threat to the research, and it could affect the safety of the whole Tokamak system. Therefore, to keep the high energy plasma research work continuable and safe, it is necessary to conduct regular inspection operation of the toroidal vessel during the experiment intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the existing in-vessel operation solutions, this project developed an arcuate spreading-arm featured manipulator (see the figure attached) for the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (the first superconducting Tokamak in China). The manipulator is made up with four main parts, which are the deployment platform, the arcuate spreading big arm, the planar small arm and the end effector. It can be deployed from the narrow entrance window of the toroidal vessel, can cover the large toroidal vessel workspace, and can adapt to the complex geometry constrains of the D-shape section place in toroidal vessel. A manipulator prototype was manufactured and tested in the EAST toroidal vessel mock-up to validate the overall in-vessel operation process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
