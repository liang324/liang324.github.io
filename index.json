In this context, we aimed to study whether DWI could reflect the active tissue injury and edema information of HCM which were usually indicated by T2 weighted images. Forty HCM patients were examined using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner. Cine, T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery (T2-STIR), DWI and LGE sequences were acquired. T1 mapping was also included to quantify the focal and diffuse fibrosis. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was tested to assess the recently myocardial injury. Student’s t-test, Mann–Whitney U test, One-way analysis, Kruskal–Wallis analysis, the Spearman correlation analysis, and multivariable regression were used in this study. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was significantly elevated in the cTnI positive group (P = 0.01) and correlated with LGE (ρ = 0.312, P = 0.049) and HighT2 extent (ρ = 0.443, P = 0.004) in the global level. In the segmental analysis, the ADC significantly differentiated the segments with and without HighT2/LGE presence (P = 0.00). The average ADC values were higher in segments with HighT2 and LGE coexistence than in those with only LGE presence (P ","tags":["CMR","Mechine Learing"],"title":"Diffusion-weighted imaging in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: association with high T2-weighted signal intensity in addition to late gadolinium enhancement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["DU Liang","ZHANG Weijun","YUAN Jianjun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"92c60c25710caf4b14b84ce3e086815b","permalink":"https://liang324.github.io/publication/du2020design/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/du2020design/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims to present the design and experimental tests of an active circulating cooling system for the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak in-vessel inspection manipulator, which will help the current manipulator prototype to achieve a full-scale in-vessel high temperature environment compatibility.","tags":["automation","robot","design","conceptual"],"title":"Design and experimental tests of an active cooling system for a kind of in-vessel inspection manipulator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MA Shugen","DU Liang","TSUCHIYA Erina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"4d35c35e7ff52f058a82e337bdbce17a","permalink":"https://liang324.github.io/publication/ma2020made/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ma2020made/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose two paper-made grippers for the increasing soft object grasping requirements in the food processing field.","tags":["soft robot","origami","design"],"title":"Paper Made Grippers for Soft Food Grasping","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Specialized robot that helps release humans from dangerous TBM maintenance works underground.\nTunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a kind of specialized engineering machine for excavating underground tunnels. The modern TBMs are technology-intensive systems that can perform various comprehensive tasks such as tunnel boring, excavated material removal and tunnel structure supporting at the same time, which greatly improves the overall project efficiency, quality and safety. The cutting head part of a shield TBM is specialized for underground hard rock material tunneling (see the featured figure).\nThe disc cutters, arranged at the forefront cutting head part of the TBM, are the main cutting tools for cutting hard rock materials. The disc cutters are pressed onto the cutting surface with enough force so that the rock structure will crash as a result. As the cutting head rotates, the disc cutters will rotate round its own shaft and move along circle path on the cutting surface at the same time to form an even full-surface cutting result. The disc cutters will endure large working load to meet the rock crushing result, and they work in a complex extreme situation underground, with high pressure, high humidity and high temperature, so that the disc cutter worn-out and faulty is quite often during the boring process, which may affect the work efficiency and quality or even endanger the TBM system. Therefore, the regular replacement of the worn/damaged disc cutter in time is crucial for the normal running of the TBM machine, maintaining high operation productivity and keeping the system safety.\nThis project aims develop unmanned robot that can help release humans from dangerous TBM maintenance works underground.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"44f7a849021c61080160619247332916","permalink":"https://liang324.github.io/project/2018-tbm/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-tbm/","section":"project","summary":"Specialized robot that helps release humans from dangerous TBM maintenance works underground.\n","tags":null,"title":"Underground Disc-cutter Replacement Robot for Tunnel Boring Machine","type":"project"},{"authors":["DU Liang","ZHANG Weijun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"bcdc2d4264aa9eac055a00ac20906e26","permalink":"https://liang324.github.io/publication/du2019teleoperated/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/du2019teleoperated/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a teleoperated robotic hot stick platform for the overhead live powerline maintenance tasks.","tags":["automation","robot","design","conceptual"],"title":"A teleoperated robotic hot stick platform for the overhead live powerline maintenance tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A robot that works inside Tokamak, an experimental device for nuclear fusion research.\nTokamak is the experiment device for controlled nuclear fusion research, which employs magnetic field to confine the high energy plasma in its toroidal vessel for nuclear fusion activities.

This is a severe threat to the research, and it could affect the safety of the whole Tokamak system.
